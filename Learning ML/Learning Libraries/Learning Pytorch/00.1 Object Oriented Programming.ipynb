    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python helps you structure your code by grouping related data and behaviors into objects. You start by defining classes, which act as blueprints, and then create objects from them. OOP simplifies modeling real-world concepts in your programs and enables you to build systems that are more reusable and scalable."

    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation** allows you to bundle data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) within a class to create a cohesive unit. By defining methods to control access to attributes and its modification, encapsulation helps maintain data integrity and promotes modular, secure code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance** enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. This promotes code reuse and reduces duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction** focuses on hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential functionality of an object. By enforcing a consistent interface, abstraction simplifies interactions with objects, allowing developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism** allows you to treat objects of different types as instances of the same base type, as long as they implement a common interface or behavior. Python’s duck typing make it especially suited for polymorphism, as it allows you to access attributes and methods on objects without needing to worry about their actual class."
