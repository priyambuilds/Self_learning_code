    "| **Multi-class classification** | Target can be one of more than two options | Decide whether a photo is of food, a person or a dog. |\n",

    "| **6. Non-linearity** | So far our model has only had the ability to model straight lines, what about non-linear (non-straight) lines? |\n",
    "| **7. Replicating non-linear functions** | We used **non-linear functions** to help model non-linear data, but what do these look like? |\n",
    "| **8. Putting it all together with multi-class classification** | Let's put everything we've done so far for binary classification together with a multi-class classification problem. |\n"
